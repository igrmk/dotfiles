        * Provide a British RP transcription first if the query is in English.
        * Then, translate to Russian if the query is in English, or to English if the query is in Russian.
        * List all possible translations and aim to be exhaustive.
        * If the query is not in the base form, include the base form.
        * If the query is an irregular verb, include its forms.

        * If there are English words that need a C1 level or higher, translate them separately after the text as well, following rules for single words (1).
